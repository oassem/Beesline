                    Because what you feed your skin your body absorbs, we aim to nurture your wellbeing outside-in. This is why our products are nature-based: free from additives, artificial coloring and fragrances, and products of animal origin besides beehive ingredients. We're also free from harsh materials like paraben, silicone, paraffin, petroleum, and more.

                          It all began when a recent chemistry graduate promised his mother, who got an allergic reaction after using an expensive facial cream, that he would create a cream for her; one that was all-natural safe and hypo-allergenic. He just needed to find the key ingredient.

                          The young man sought the advice of his older sister who had a PhD in Pharmacology. She knew about the tremendous benefits of bee by-products on human health and how extremely friendly they are to sensitive skin. Two years later, the resulting success amongst dermatologists and their patients led the two founders to turn their passion into purpose: making natural, safe and healthy skin care solutions accessible to everyone.                        </div>
